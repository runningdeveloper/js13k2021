Not sure what to make yet

## Build log

- Started blank project based on last year. Wanted to use snowpack to make development easier, so setup build and etc. Hopefully settle on a game idea soon.
- Got a concept brewing - astronaut doing an EVA needs to do something on the outside of a ship, can move around using jet pack type thing puffing jets. Could have limited fuel, oxygen and etc to time limit things. Got some blocks on the screen testing movement things. 8kb seems big
